      Music and movies are significant aspects of human life that provide people with relaxation during difficult times. More than any other activity, people like to listen to music or watch movies. Millions of individuals across the world now have access to a vast amount of music and movie content from a variety of genres due to internet technology. The main challenge for users is choosing appropriate music or movies from such a large collection.
      
      
       To overcome this problem a recommender system is developed. System which makes suggestions that usually filters the given data using multiple methods and suggests the relevant one to the customer's benefit. This recommender system will recommend music and movies to the user based on their mood along with an emoticon symbolizing their mood.
